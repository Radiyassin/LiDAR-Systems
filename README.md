# LiDAR Systems

This repository includes the seminar paper and related resources from my research project at FH Aachen. The project offers a comprehensive overview of LiDAR systems: how they work, current technologies, and their role across multiple industries.

## 📄 About the Research

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a remote sensing method that uses laser light to measure distances. This paper covers:

- 📡 Core Components: Laser emitters, detectors, and beam steering  
- ⚙️ Types of LiDAR: Mechanical, MEMS, Solid-State  
- 🌍 Applications:
  - Autonomous vehicles
  - Urban mapping & GIS
  - Robotics & drones
  - Forestry & environmental science
  - Archaeology and historical preservation
